# Learning Outcomes
<h3>Project Handling</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Practice : I was successful at implementing the 2 Q’s during the first half of the project, which was incredibly helpful. My ardency decreased as the project neared completion, which is an unskillful tendency I look forward to tweaking during my next project.</li>
  <li>Insight #1 : The NUMBER ONE skill for me to hone as an aspiring developer may be to view each new concept and task not as an obstacle in the way of getting to the finish line, but rather another great opportunity to solve a problem in a clear and skilled way.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Programming</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Practice : When new concepts or methods need to be learned and applied to my project, working them from a blank CodePen in isolation keeps things very clear and concise. Trying to learn it by integrating it into an in-progress page adds unnecessary complexity.</li>
  <li>Insight :  I am unsatisfied with my current ability to structure this application’s code. In Javascript, I am looking forward to learning more about design patterns and frameworks. In CSS, I am eager to implement SASS as a way to nest code in a more visually encapsulated way.</li>
</ul>
